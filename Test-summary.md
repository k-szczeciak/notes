# MarCator test summary Report


### Good:
- Animations and comments (e.g. START/STOP, Preset switching, animation in menue)
- clear statements and explanantion when e.g. "No fcn" ->"Tol Act" 
- Intuitiveness
- New Analog inverted display
- 3xPresets and Tolerances
- quick setting digital values using probe
- Switching tolerance scaling on analoge scale
### Reported bugs:
- none so far

### Reported issues with handling:
- Hardware: LEDs display - yellow LED phisical position is fixed in place, hence not intuitive when only tolerance is active - expected illumination on the side of overflow. It does not correspond with Arrows on LCD display.
	- sugestion 2-color LEDs on sides (yellow or red) that it can indicate status and direction. Or all RGB leds.
- No "MAX-MIN" (TIR) in BR-variant as this is concidered as full equiped model.
- switching "PRI -> PRII  -> PRIII" not intuitive with right arrow.
	- Suggestion: PRESET long press as it is in measurement mode - consistent handling in both modes
- Editing with sensor: progressive curve (speed dependent) and decrement with retraction
- "Home" functionality in Menue under "IO" (short press) in case when confirmation (with right lower button) means activation of value (e.g. in preset). Also as quick return to "Home" screen from any place in menue as a "quick rescue"
- More descriptions when "No Fcn" message is displyed, possible everywhere
- variable Display refreshrate (set in Menue). Now is 16Hz (maybe 8Hz an 4Hz selectable or even 32Hz???), which is for some too high. In other devices like Caliper or Micromar is lower.
	- my comment: That also will save current, hence prolong battery life.
- no option for factory "FA-set" setting when No DKU1 cale is availbe and and menue is locked.
	- My comment: we can use the same procedure as planned for display test (when no measurement system is detected and button pressed when battery inserted)
- Hardware: too easy to for taking display from Measurments apart. That may easliy damage measurment  ribbon cable.
- Moving MAX or MIN values when switching between MIN and MAX when calibrated with master of a different shape, e.g. master with Squere shape and measured piece with round shape. Master is set with min and measured piece is measured with max.
- MarCom: Foot switch with option as Start/Stop functionality.
