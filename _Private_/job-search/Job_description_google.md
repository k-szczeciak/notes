The Consensus team builds and owns mission-critical services at the bottom of all of Google services. Chief among them are Chubby which is used for locking, naming, and state distribution. The dev team is rethinking Chubby's architecture to separate and specialize its key use cases while meeting increasing scalability, performance, and reliability targets.  Help us build the core primitives underlying Google’s scalable distributed systems. The Consensus team owns software running nearly everywhere Google’s servers are present all over the world.
